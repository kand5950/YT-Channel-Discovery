# Project Description

YT Discovery App lets you discover new recommended channels based off your subscriptions. The user can log in with a Youtube account and view all their subscriptions and information about them. Users are then able to see the subscriptions of their subscribers and channels they recommend. Added sorting functionality to find what channels the user might be interested in.

The app was built as a final project for the lighthouse Labs Web Development Diploma Program. The front-end of the app was built with React and SASS. Using Youtube Data API and Google identity program to percieve query requests and chaining promises to get data needed.
